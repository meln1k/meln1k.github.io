Hello everyone.

My name is Nikita, I'm a software engineer from Yekaterinburg, Russia. I decided to start a blog. Why did I do that?

At first, I want to systematize my knowledge about various topics on software development. Some of them are distributed 
programming, functional programming, concurrency, and machine learning. In my view, transforming set of thoughts into 
structured post is a good way for understanding topics.

Next, English is my second language. I think writing in blog will help me to become a better writer.

Finally, I want to share my experience, and I'd be glad if you leave some comments.

I hope my posts will be interesting for you, so stay tuned.
